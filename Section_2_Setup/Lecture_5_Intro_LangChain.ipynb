    "LangChain is a powerful Python framework designed to help you build applications powered by large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of LangChain as a **construction toolkit**‚Äîit helps you add memory, decision logic, and tool access to language models, so they behave more like smart assistants or agents rather than just chatbots."

    "- Remember things from earlier in a conversation\n",
    "- Decide what tool to use\n",
    "- Integrate with APIs, documents, or databases\n",
    "\n",
    "LangChain makes it easy to do all that. It connects your LLM to memory, tools, and custom workflows‚Äîso your AI agent can **think, decide, and act**."
