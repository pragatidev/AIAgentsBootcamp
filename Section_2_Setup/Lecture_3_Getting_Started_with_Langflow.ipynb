    "Instead of writing code, you can simply **drag and drop components** to visually build workflows for your AI agents.\n",

    "\n",
    "- 🧱 **Visual Workflow**: Build agents without writing code.\n",
    "- 🧠 **Understand the Flow**: Perfect for learning how LangChain components work together.\n",
    "- 🔄 **Iterate Fast**: No need to run and debug Python code repeatedly.\n",
    "- 🔌 **Plug and Play**: Integrate GPT-4, APIs, memory, and other tools visually.\n",
    "\n",
    "Langflow helps you **design, test, and experiment** before moving to complex code logic."
